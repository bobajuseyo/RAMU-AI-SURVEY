# RAMU AI SURVEY
AI Innovation for Smart Hospital & Healthcare Service Hackathon 2025

## ðŸ’¡ Overview
**RAMU AI SURVEY** is an AI-powered voice-based survey platform developed during the *AI Innovation for Smart Hospital & Healthcare Service Hackathon 2025*.  

The project aims to **enhance hospital efficiency** and **improve patient engagement** by using **Speech-to-Text technology** that allows patients to respond to surveys through voice instead of typing.  
This approach reduces response barriers, increases participation rates, and enables hospitals to collect more accurate and accessible feedback from patients â€” helping evaluate satisfaction and improve healthcare services more effectively.
